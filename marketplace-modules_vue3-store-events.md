Vue 3 Store Events Migration Guide
As part of our upcoming Vue 3 migration, we've introduced a new and safer way for Marketplace apps to listen for store changes. Direct access to the Vue instance (__vue__, $store, $router) will no longer be available in Vue 3.
To ensure your apps continue to function seamlessly, please migrate to the new StoreEvents API for store subscriptions.
✅ How to Register for Store Updates
Use window.AppUtils.StoreEvents.register() to subscribe to the store modules your app depends on.
Example:
// Register for store updates
const subscriptionId = window.AppUtils.StoreEvents.register(
  ["auth", "user"], // list of store modules
  ({ module, state, mutation }) => {
    console.log("Update from:", module, state, mutation);
  }
);

// Unregister when not needed
window.AppUtils.StoreEvents.unregister(subscriptionId);
Important Notes:
Each app subscribes only to the modules it needs.
On every mutation, your callback will be triggered with { module, state[module], mutation }.
Apps should unregister subscriptions when no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
🔄 Route Change Events
For route navigation, please use the routeChangeEvent provided in AppUtils instead of router.beforeEach.
Example:
document.addEventListener("routeChangeEvent", (e) => {
  console.log("Route changed:", e.detail);
});
