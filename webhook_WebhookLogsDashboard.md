Accessing Webhook Logs
Navigation Steps

Click on Logs
The Webhooks tab will be active by default
URL Pattern
/app-settings/{your-app-id}/dashboard/logs
Understanding the Dashboard
Statistics Cards
The dashboard displays three key metrics at the top of the page. Important: These statistics show data for the last 24 hours and are independent of your date range filters.
Total Events
Shows the number of unique events received during the selected period
Includes both successful and failed webhooks
Updates based on your selected date range and filters
Deduplicates by webhook ID
Consumer Errors
Displays webhooks that failed (non-2xx status codes)
High numbers indicate potential issues with your webhook endpoint
Total Attempts
Shows all delivery attempts including retries
If this number is higher than Total Events, your app is experiencing retries
Helps identify webhook delivery issues
NOTE: Webhooks are retried with a 10-minute interval (with jitter) for up to 6 attempts when your endpoint returns a 429 status code. For detailed retry policy information, see the Error Handling and Retries section.
Logs Table
The logs table displays the following columns:
Column Description Example
Event Name Type of webhook event ContactCreate, INSTALL
Webhook ID Unique identifier for tracking abc123def456...
Attempted At When the webhook was sent 2024-11-13 14:30:45
Status Code HTTP response status 200 (success) or 404 (error)
Attempt # Delivery attempt number 1st, 2nd, 3rd
Status codes are color-coded: green for success (2xx) and red for errors (all others).
Using Date & Time Filters
Date & Time Pickers
By default, the logs display the last 1 hour of webhook activity
You can change the date range with up to 1 second accuracy for any period within the past 30 days
The date pickers provide quick shortcuts:
Today: Jump to today's date
Last 7 Days: View the past week
Last 30 Days: View the past month (maximum range)
NOTE: Logs are retained for the last 30 days
Changing Timezone
All webhook times are stored in UTC, but you can view them in your local timezone for easier reading.
How to Change Timezone
Locate the timezone dropdown on the right
Click and start typing your timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")
Select your timezone from the list
All times will instantly convert to your selected timezone
Timezone Features
Your selection is saved automatically
All times in the table update immediately
Modal details also display in your selected timezone
Search for timezones by typing
Example:
UTC: 2024-11-13 14:30:00
Eastern Time: 2024-11-13 09:30:00
Searching Logs
Global Search Bar
The search bar is located in the top-left of the table and allows you to search for specific webhooks.
What You Can Search
Webhook ID: Enter the full or partial webhook ID
Webhook Payloads: Enter the value or full key-value pair to search in the payload
How to Search
Click in the search box
To search by webhook ID: Type your webhook ID (e.g., abc123....)
To search by payload: Enter the value or full key-value pair from the payload
Example payload:
{
  "type": "OpportunityCreate",
  "locationId": "3jJ0coeqWCZMAosyGQ6K",
  "versionId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9",

}
Any substring of value will work. ex - FPg9uhhnCe (substring from contactId)
Any one key-value pair will work. ex - "contactId": "VQxH1EeoFPg9uhhnCeJx" or name: Test 2 (quotes not important)
random substring of json will not work. ex - sionId": "6878cec452e7c8d29d4dd3d9", "appId": "6878cec452e7c

Common Use Cases
Use Case 1: Finding a Specific Webhook
Scenario: Support provided a webhook ID to investigate
Steps:
Copy the webhook ID
Paste it in the search bar
Press Enter or wait for auto-search
Click the row to see full details
Use Case 2: Troubleshooting Failed Webhooks
Scenario: Your app isn't receiving webhooks properly
Steps:
Open Status Code filter
Click "Filter By Failure"
Click "Apply"
Review the failed webhooks
Click rows to see error codes and payloads
Look for patterns:
All 404? Your endpoint URL might be wrong
All 401? Check authentication
All 500? Your server has errors
Use Case 3: Checking Retry Behavior
Scenario: You want to see if webhooks are being retried
Steps:
Look at the "Attempt #" column
Search for a specific Webhook ID that appears multiple times
Look for entries like "2nd", "3rd", "4th"
High attempt numbers indicate persistent failures
Click to view details and see what changed between attempts
Use Case 4: Monitoring Event Volume
Scenario: You want to know how many webhooks you're receiving
Steps:
Set date range to "Last 7 Days" or "Last 30 Days"
Look at "Total Events" statistic
Compare to "Total Attempts"
High difference indicates many retries happening
Check "Consumer Errors" to see failure rate
Use Case 5: Focusing on Specific Events
Scenario: You only care about contact-related webhooks
Steps:
Open Event Name filter
Click "Filter by Values"
Type "CONTACT" in the search box
Select all contact events:
ContactCreate
ContactUpdate
ContactDelete
Click "Apply"
Now you only see contact webhooks
Use Case 6: Investigating Issues at Specific Time
Scenario: Your app had issues yesterday at 2 PM
Steps:
Select your timezone first
Set start date/time to yesterday 2:00 PM
Set end date/time to yesterday 3:00 PM
Open Status Code filter
Click "Filter By Failure"
Review what went wrong during that hour
Use Case 7: Comparing Success vs Failure
Scenario: You want to see the success rate
Steps:
Note "Total Events" number
Note "Consumer Errors" number
Calculate: (Total Events - Consumer Errors) / Total Events × 100
Example: (1000 - 50) / 1000 = 95% success rate
Filter by failures to investigate the remaining percentage
Use Case 8: Post-Deployment Verification
Scenario: You just deployed a webhook fix
Steps:
Note the deployment time in your timezone
Set start time to deployment time
Set end time to now
Filter by the event name you fixed
Check "Consumer Errors" should be low/zero
